# Javascript Text Animation

- Javascript text animation.
- No canvas, vanilla javascript only.

## Features

- setTimeout()
- recursive functions
- vanilla javascript DOM manipulation
- HTML "onclick" attributes
- Javascript "onkeydown"
- show/hide toggle with vanilla javascript

## To-Do's

- keydown function for ENTER
- add user text input

- variables for user input and responses.

- add in web sounds, to replace play() function
- fix text wrap

- scan lines
- robot wakes up on window.load
- turn-on animation and analog switch image


## Issues

- play() functions can't keep up with text animation setInterval() speed.
- how should I handle user input, and dedicated responses? right now, they just go in order.

- should change id attributes to classes, forgot how to do DOM selectors in vanilla javascript
- should I just use jQuery? forgot how to do jQuery
- how do you split this up into multiple js files? in header? what about the global variables?
- where should I put the different <script> files? head, top of body, or bottom of body?
